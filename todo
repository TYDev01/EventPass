Build a modern, professional event ticketing website using Next.js (App Router) and shadcn/ui.
The design should follow this exact theme:

Background: White base with smooth accent gradients using #fc6432 (burnt orange).

Example: subtle radial gradient in top-right corner blending white → #fc6432 (10% opacity).

Header (Navbar):

Transparent glassmorphism effect (blur + opacity + backdrop-filter).

Slight rounded corners (2xl).

The navbar does not touch the edges of the browser — it’s centered horizontally with padding on both sides.

Contains:

Logo (left)

Navigation links (“Home”, “Events”, “My Tickets”, “Create Event”)

“Connect Wallet” button on the right.

Typography: Use modern, clean fonts (e.g. Inter, Manrope, or Urbanist).

Layout:

Hero section with large event banner, short tagline, and a “Browse Events” button.

Events grid below (cards using shadcn’s <Card /> with shadows, rounded corners, and hover scale).

Each card should show:

Event image

Title

Date

Location

Price / “Buy Ticket” button.

Footer: Minimal with small logo, copyright, and social links.

Transitions: Smooth hover and fade animations using Framer Motion.

Tech stack:

Next.js 14+ (App Router)

TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui components

Framer Motion for animations

Lucide icons for minimal line icons

Files to include:

/components/Header.tsx

/components/EventCard.tsx

/components/Footer.tsx

/app/page.tsx (Hero + Events Grid)

The resulting design should feel elegant, glassy, and high-end, suitable for a real-world ticketing brand.
